TEXT: The attacks associated with the new botnet attempted to exploit the CVE-2017-17215 zero-day vulnerability in the Huawei home router caused by the fact that the TR-064 technical report standard, which was designed for local network configuration, was exposed to WAN through port 37215 (UPnP – Universal Plug and Play).
VALUE: CVE-2017-17215
LABEL: SV

TEXT: About 12 hours ago (2017-12-05 11:57 AM GMT+8), we noticed a new version of Satori (a mirai variant which we named Satori), starting to propagate very quickly on port 37215 and 52869.
VALUE: port 37215 and 52869
LABEL: Port

TEXT: Two new exploits, which work on port 37215 and 52869 have been added, see below for more details.
VALUE: port 37215 and 52869
LABEL: Port

TEXT: Due to the worm like behavior, we all should be on the lookout for the port 37215 and 52869 scan traffic.
VALUE: port 37215 and 52869
LABEL: Port

TEXT: For those who don’t have the visibility, feel free to check out our free Scanmon system for port 37215 and 52869, or ISC port pages for 37215 and 52869.
VALUE: port 37215 and 52869
LABEL: Port

TEXT: As can be seen from the following picture, the bot will scan port 37215 and 52869 randomly, determined by the remainder of a random integer mod 3.
VALUE: port 37215 and 52869
LABEL: Port

TEXT: During the scanning, Satori will utilize two different exploits, one on port 37215, while the other on 52869.
VALUE: 52869
LABEL: Port

TEXT: The one on port 37215 is not fully disclosed yet, our team has been tracking this in the last few days and got quite some insight, but we will not discuss it here right now.(stay tuned for our update later).
VALUE: port 37215
LABEL: Port

TEXT: For example, during last recent 12 hours we have seen 263,250 different IPs scanning port 37215, and 19,403 IPs scanning port 52869.
VALUE: port 52869
LABEL: Port

TEXT: We analyzed another Mirai variant called “Miori,” which is being spread through a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the PHP framework, ThinkPHP.
VALUE: Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the PHP framework, ThinkPHP.
LABEL: SV

TEXT: For its arrival method, the IoT botnet uses the said exploit that affects ThinkPHP versions prior to 5.0.23 and 5.1.31.
VALUE: ThinkPHP
LABEL: SV

TEXT: Our own analysis revealed that the cybercriminals behind Miori used the ThinkPHP RCE to make vulnerable machines download and execute their malware.
VALUE: ThinkPHP RCE
LABEL: SV

TEXT: With Mirai Comes Miori: IoT Botnet Delivered via ThinkPHP Remote Code Execution Exploit.
VALUE: Remote Code Execution
LABEL: SV

TEXT: Miori now spreading via Remote code execution vulnerability in
VALUE: Remote code execution
LABEL: SV

TEXT: The Miori bot borrows the code from the dreaded Mirai malware and it first appeared in the threat landscape in late 2018 when the bot was spread by exploiting a ThinkPHP remote code execution vulnerability after the exploit code was made publicly available. 
VALUE: ThinkPHP remote code execution
LABEL: SV

TEXT: Among the list of devices targeted by the Wicked Mirai are Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 routers (also used by Reaper botnet).
VALUE: DGN2200 v1 routers
LABEL: Model

TEXT: Specifically, port 8080 brings an exploit for a flaw in Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 routers (also used by the Reaper botnet).
VALUE: DGN2200 v1 routers
LABEL: Model

TEXT: On port 8080, the malware uses Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 router exploits (also used by Reaper botnet).
VALUE: DGN2200 v1 router
LABEL: Model

TEXT: If connected to Port 8080, the malware will use a remote code execution (RCE) Netgear exploit which works on DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 routers, and is the same tool used by the Reaper botnet to compromise target machines.
VALUE: DGN2200 v1 routers
LABEL: Model

TEXT: On port 8080, Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 router exploits are used, a CCTV-DVR remote code execution exploit is used on port 81, 
VALUE: port 81
LABEL: Port

TEXT: Below is a list of devices targeted by the Wicked Mirai; Port 8080: Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 routers.
VALUE: DGN2200 v1 routers
LABEL: Model

TEXT: Devices Targeted by Wicked include Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 routers on Port 8080.
VALUE: Port 8080
LABEL: Port

TEXT: The dissection of this suspicious file, known by Symantec as Trojan.Emotet, shows common elements such as: TCP communication over ports 80, 8080, 22,990.
VALUE: ports 80, 8080, 22,990
LABEL: Port

TEXT: Emotet connects to C2 servers on various ports including, but not limited to: 20, 80, 443, 7080, 8443, and 50000
VALUE: 20, 80, 443, 7080, 8443, and 50000
LABEL: Port

TEXT: We can see that port 80 returns the same universal 404 error as the hacked server did on the Emotet port, so most likely this is the port it forwards traffic to.
VALUE: port 80
LABEL: Port

TEXT: The C2 servers can receive these communications on port 80, which is the default port for HTTP, but may also receive them on port 443, which is the default for HTTPS traffic, or on a number of other nonstandard ports, including but not limited to 7080, 8080, 8090, 50000, or several others. 
VALUE: 7080, 8080, 8090, 50000
LABEL: Port

TEXT: The initial executable appears to launch an application application lpiograd.exe, seen in Figure 2 and then looks to make outbound network connections on port 80, to a single command and control (CnC) server
VALUE: port 80
LABEL: Port

TEXT: Emotet Trojan used commonly used port for communication (e.g TCP port 80, 8080, 443, 8443, 7080, 20, 22, 53)
VALUE: TCP port 80, 8080, 443, 8443, 7080, 20, 22, 53
